Hey, I am Michael. I am currently doing a master's degree in Mathematics at the University of Hamburg. Before that, I double majored in Mathematics and Computer Science at 
the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. 
Academically, I am primarily interested in Discrete Mathematics (mostly Extremal Combinatorics), which was also the area of my bachelor's thesis. I am also interested in Probability Theory and Logic, really anything that has applications to Computer Science.

In my freetime, I enjoy collecting vinyls, playing piano, singing, watching movies, programming, bouldering, playing badminton and cooking.
