# Why this blog?

Frankly, I don't *care* about web development and haven't had any past experience with it. 
Still, I decided to make a website because:

1. It seems professional to have your own website. 
1. Github Pages lets you host a static website for free. 
1. There are pretty templates out there to make your own website. 
1. To give a more serious reason, I enjoy to write most of my notes (if I make any) in <span class="latex">L<span>a</span>T<span>e</span>X</span> and thought that I might as well share them. 
1. Another serious reason: If it helps someone to get through university by reading about my past experiences, then I'll gladly talk about them. 

# A shoutout

Now, as you might have noticed, this website looks like <span class="latex">L<span>a</span>T<span>e</span>X</span> and this is actually by design: I found this very nice [template](https://github.com/ryanmcdermott/jekyll-latex) by Ryan McDermott. I don't know him personally but if you see this, I wanted to say thanks for putting up this nice template.

# What I won't do

Even though this is a blog, I will only talk about technical things or my academic experience rather than anything too personal. 
I hope it suffices to know that -- for example -- I love Euler's formula 

$$ |V| - |E| + |F| = 2$$

for connected, planar graphs $G$. Isn't that personal enough? ;)

I also don't plan to write about stuff too regularly. 

# Enjoy

And I guess that's it for now. Stay tuned for more!
