Well, another semester has gone by. I am kind of busy, so I will keep things short: 
Currently, I am working towards my Master's thesis. It's the only thing that I still need to do to finish the degree. 
Other than that, I am registered as a listener to

- Infinite Graph Theory,
- Introduction to Random Graphs, and 
- Additive Combinatorics. 

Unfortunately, the classes of the second course are at around 8 am and I am not willing to get up for something I don't need to take.
I am enjoying the other two classes though. Infinite Graph Theory kind of hurts my brain, like, telling myself that there are planar graphs 
with higher connectivity than $5$ is really quite strange. But man, that proof of Cantor-Bernstein's Theorem was really, really elegant. Maybe 
I will find the time to make it a whole video, which I think it deserves. 

Additive Combinatorics on the other hand is cool just because of Reiher. It's still funny what sort of things he says during lecture, like (and I am paraphrasing): 

> Today we will learn about the Pl端nnecke's inequality. Apart from that, there was nothing really interesting Pl端nnecke did. Then again, the normal mathematician does nothing interesting in their life, so Pl端nnecke is a comparably good mathematician. 

Other news: I applied for a visiting program in Korea! More specifically, I will be doing research (or my attempt thereof) at the Extremal Combinatorics and Probability Group of the IBS in Daejeon. Visa has been a pain, but otherwise I am just really looking forward to it. Funnily enough, when I was celebrating my birthday, I caught up with a friend and realized that I hadn't checked my e-mails that day. Man, was I slapping that guy's friend when I discovered that I got in. 

And yeah, I am also now part of Studenten bilden Sch端ler (e.V.), been that for awhile though it doesn't feel like it, and also joined the chamber choir of the university. And I should probably look into PhD programs$\dots$, so yeah, this will be quite the semester.
