I will keep this short as it's quite late already. 

So, this blog has been quite quiet. So what happened since then?

Basically, I am currently finishing my master's thesis under Mathias. Before that I was in Korea for two months in the ECOPRO research group under Hong Liu and had to apply to a bunch of PhD places. Man, stressful times. 

Oh, well that's done and we have good news: Another paper! 

This came from a collaboration that was initiated through the <a href="https://www.ibs.re.kr/ecopro/1st-ecopro-combinatorial-week-workshop-2023/">1st ECOPRO Combinatorial Week workshop 2023</a>. 

Funnily enough, as I am currently back in Karlsruhe and Letícia is giving a talk this week, I decided to go to the talk yesterday / today. 
It was nice seeing some familiar faces and talking with some former student colleagues, and Felix Clemen, Dingyuan Liu and Letícia. 
The most *random* (pun intended) part was, however, that Letícia last-minute decided to give a talk on that preprint! It's the first time that I sat in the room while someone else is talking about a paper where I was a co-author. Oh well. 

On our (me, Dingyuan, Felix and Letícia) trip to the palace, we also made Jakob (Zimmermann) who recently finished his bachelor thesis under Maria. Turns out -- this was news to me -- that his result and his thesis got cited by Jacob Fox and he will be going to Berlin for Szabó! To think that I tutored that guy just two years ago on an introductory class in graph theory, that's quite a jump. 

To be fair, I am going to Atlanta for my PhD in less than three months. Time really moves. At least I also got to spend some time with friends today too. :)
