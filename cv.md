<h3>Bachelor's Thesis</h3>

--- | --- 
Title | *Interval Colorings of Graphs*
Supervisor | Professor Dr. Maria Axenovich 
Description | This thesis is devoted to a particular edge coloring problem, that of interval colorability: A graph $G$ is called *interval colorable* if there is an assignment of integers to its edges such that each vertex is incident to edges colored by a set of consecutive integers and there are no two adjacent edges of the same color.
Grade | 1.0

<h3>Master's Thesis</h3>

--- | --- 
Title | *On the Existence of Steiner Triple Systems in 3-uniform Hypergraphs*
Supervisor | Professor Dr. Mathias Schacht
Description | This thesis concerns itself with a possible generalization of Dirac's theorem for perfect matchings, one of the fundamental results in graph theory. More specifically, we study the minimum codegree threshold for a 3-uniform hypergraph to contain a (spanning) Steiner triple system, which can be seen as the ''higher-dimensional'' analogue of a perfect matching.  
Grade | 1.0
